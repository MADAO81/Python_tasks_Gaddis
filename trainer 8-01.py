# Let's say that the choice variable refers to a string value. The following
# if statement determines whether the choice variable is equal to the values 'Y' or 'y':
# if choice == 'Y' or choice == 'y': 
# Rewrite this instruction so that it does just one comparison and uses
# the or operator.

if choice.lower() == "y"
